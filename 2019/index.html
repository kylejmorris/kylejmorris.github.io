  <main>
    <p>2019 was the most crazy year of my life. I wrote 3 drafts  summarizing it, but my perspective kept changing. Instead I&rsquo;m just publishing shortform what went down.</p>
<p>January:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: got into the 6 uni classes I wanted. Super amped!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: split with gf of ~3 years. Really sad. Distracting myself with exam prep. Each day: wake up, drink coffee, study, sleep. Strong support network kept me sane &lt;3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>February:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: Aced all classes. allowing for chill time to chat with a close friend Aaron Peddle about business ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: really miss gf. gradschool rejection letters coming in. what do I do after grad?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>March:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: Helped a couple friends by applying to jobs for them in exchange for $. Talked with Aaron about this as neat business opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: studying 6am-7pm on campus, then moonlighting startup from 8pm-11pm and primarily sleeping on campus .</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>April:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: nailed exams for semester. launched &ldquo;repstem&rdquo; to automate the job hunt for engineers. repstem has a couple paying users now + one new user we met through organic referral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: exam season makes me sleepy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>May:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: repstem making ~$200/month with ~4 users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: signed up for a japanese course that was 5 days/week &amp; multiple hours/day. its insanely hard. Moonlighting startup + barely passing first half of course, freaking out about potentially not graduating because I can&rsquo;t memorize all the verb conjugations. feeling antsy, booked flight to Africa for change of vibe and perspective shift.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>June:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: got into Harvard business school. survived uni. Repstem at ~14 paying users. partnered with a coding bootcamp from silicon valley, time to haul ass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: weird feeling to be done Uni. lots of systems &amp; support structures: gone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>July:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: amazing experience in uganda/kenya/rwanda/tanzania. summited Kilimanjaro with food poisoning. repstem at 30+ users. cut trip short to setup office in Los Angeles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: something feels a bit off. slight apathy to everything. unsure why.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>August:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: dating a fashion model in Hollywood feels cool. There is a dave&rsquo;n busters arcade with a great DDR machine! Repstem doing ok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: very low energy for anything. grinding long days. hard to focus on anything.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>September:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: i&rsquo;m alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: unable to close preseed investment round for Repstem. bussing from LA to SF and was working on repstem + pitching 18+ hr days for a week, not eating, hadn&rsquo;t showered or shaved, and getting roasted by high profile investors who had valid concerns about the business model. sat in coffee shop for several hours. couldn&rsquo;t get enough energy to pick up my cup to take a sip. can&rsquo;t remember anything from past week. Everything is foggy. ended up back in L.A. pretty sure I took a bus at some point. dangerously sad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>October:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: went back to Canada and officially graduated. Spending time with family completely changes my mood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: burnt on repstem. No personal money left + need to support family. have to decide if I&rsquo;m going to continue working on it from Canada or return to SF and work for a different company (can&rsquo;t feasibly do both)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>November:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: got a job @ Cruise Automation, back in SF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: shutdown repstem. really hurt, but learned a lot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>December:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the good: returned to canada for christmas, feeling energized again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the growth: figuring out what to do next</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that was an experience.</p>
