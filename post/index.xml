      <description>2019 was the most crazy year of my life. I wrote 3 drafts totaling &amp;gt;10000 words trying to summarize it, but my perspective kept changing and so I felt any such summary I wrote didn&amp;rsquo;t capture how I felt. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m just publishing shortform what went down as objectively as possible.
January:
  the good: got into the 6 uni classes I wanted. Super amped!
  the growth: split with gf of ~3 years.</description>
