      <description>Tuesday, November 24, 2020 10:18am ADHD was a title given to me at a young age.
I guess its rather accurate given the nature of my attention span being shorter than a goldfish with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s.
I should clean my room at some point.
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be working, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it right now. Or rather, i&amp;rsquo;ve tried for the past hour but my mind isn&amp;rsquo;t in agreeance.
i wonder what would happen if I just wrote out my thoughts as they came?</description>

      <description>2020 September. The 9th day.
6 months after &amp;ldquo;the virus&amp;rdquo;. The meager remains of humanities reign coats a barren wasteland known as earth.
Big brother has told us to remain indoors. Unemployment is higher than the great depression. I shelter in a 7.5x7.8ft room that costs more than your college tuition, every month. I spend my day in neo-San Francisco writing codes on a personal mainframe computer that fits on my lap.</description>
